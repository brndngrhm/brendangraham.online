<p>The goal for this weeks analysis to compare 2 types of models for predicting chocolate ratings. I have read bout text based models but haven’t every attempted one, so in this analysis I will compare some text-based models with more traditional ML models.</p>
<p>The data is composed of 2,530 observations of 10 variables. There is some missing ingredients data, but all othet columes are complete.</p>

<p>Using a text based approach does perform better in this case! A lot more could probably be done to improve model performance, such as more pre-processing steps, including more predictors, trying various types of models, but the goal of this post was to try out some text based models and see how those models perform to more “traditional” ML models.</p>
